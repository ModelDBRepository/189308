This is a multicompartmental Hodgkin-Huxley-type of model of a goldfish Mauthner cell. The building and usage of the model is
described in "Differential processing in modality-specific Mauthner cell dendrites" by Violeta Medan, Tuomo Maki-Marttunen,
Julieta Sztarker, and Thomas Preuss, Journal of Physiology (2017). The model is implemented in NEURON with Python interface.

Data files saved by the scripts:

run*.dat                                # Data produced by mcell.hoc. Not used in this entry, however, as mcell.hoc is run
                                        # from the Python interface (in runmauther.py) and the data is thus saved in the memory.
activedend_decays_varyconds.sav         # Data for Figure 9A. Saved by runmauthner_activedend_decays.py. Used only if the
                                        # script is run for a second time.
activedend_decays_varyconds_activeL.sav # Data for Figure 9B. Saved by runmauthner_activedend_decays_activeL.py. Used only if the
                                        # script is run for a second time.

Before running the simulations, compile the mod files by typing

<font color=green>
nrnivmodl
</font>

For simulating the model and plotting the results (in Python), run

<font color=green>
python runmauthner.py
python runmauthner_activedend_decays_varycond.py
python runmauthner_activedend_decays_varycond_activeL.py
</font>

Output from runmauthner.py:
<img src="./fit.png" width="550" alt="Image resulting from runmauthner.py">

Output from runmauthner_activedend_decays_varycond.py:
<img src="./decay_orders_robustness.png" width="550" alt="Image resulting from runmauthner_activedend_decays_varycond.py">

Output from runmauthner_activedend_decays_varycond_activeL.py:
<img src="./decay_orders_robustness_activeL.png" width="550" alt="Image resulting from runmauthner_activedend_decays_varycond_activeL.py">
The second and third simulations are relatively heavy (take approximately half an hour on a standard computer),
and once finished, the results are saved in activedend_decays_varyconds.sav and activedend_decays_varyconds_activeL.sav
for possible later use.

Alternatively, the model can be run with the HOC interpreter as follows

<font color=green>
nrniv mcell.hoc
</font>
